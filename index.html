            <p class="sectiontag2">A portfolio is a collection of material and information that provides visual examples
                of the work you've done in a professional field. Providing a hiring manager or prospective client with
                samples of the best work you've done is an effective way to show the skills and abilities you have as a
                professional. Instead of reading about your abilities, hiring managers get to see real-life examples of
                the work you do, which is useful for gauging whether you'd be a good fit for the company and the
                position.

                A portfolio typically may include different content, such as photographs, videos, illustrations, website
                links and text. Although a wide range of professionals uses portfolios, they especially provide creative
                and artistic professionals with a means to showcase their work. Professionals who commonly use
                portfolios include artists, photographers, designers, writers, architects and developers.

                Portfolios once only were in print format, but most candidates create digital portfolios today. There
                are multiple benefits to using a digital portfolio, including the ability to share your portfolio with
                multiple people. It is also far easier to add new material and change the layout of a digital portfolio
                than is the case with a printed one.</p>
